Weather Website

Day 1 Notes
Recieved the figma from the person who's website I was going to recreate, and tried setting up a lot of the basics. Was not able to get all of what I wanted today (still trying to get over a cold) but a lot of the foundation work is there.

Day 2 Notes
I kept working on the format of the website along with the JavaScript, I was able to populate most of the information needed for the current day, not all of the fetch requests are set up so I will finish them tomorrow, the bottom 5-day forcast is set up the data just needs to populate inside.
