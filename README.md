Weather Website

Day 1 Notes
Recieved the figma from the person who's website I was going to recreate, and tried setting up a lot of the basics. Was not able to get all of what I wanted today (still trying to get over a cold) but a lot of the foundation work is there.

Day 2 Notes
I kept working on the format of the website along with the JavaScript, I was able to populate most of the information needed for the current day, not all of the fetch requests are set up so I will finish them tomorrow, the bottom 5-day forcast is set up the data just needs to populate inside.

Day 3 Notes
I was able to finish the search bar and give it functionality and was able to get all the apis called and able to populate in the console. I satarted working on the max/min of each day for the 5 day forcast and was able to get the next 5 days of the week and dates able to populate.

Day 4 Notes
Was able to finally get the forecast done and dusted, and changes depending on the location and the search bar, full functionality :)
